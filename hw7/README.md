HW7 consists of two main files that can be compiled and run:  
bst-test.cpp  
sat_solver.cpp  

Both can be compiled by entering _make_ at the command line.  

A sample invocation of bst-test would be:  
./bst-test  

A sample invocation of sat_solver would be:  
./sat_solver  

These programs also rely on changes made to:  
bst.h  
avlbst.h   

Please check the comments in the above programs for any clarifications.
