HW6 consists of two main files that can be compiled and run:  
sentences.cpp  
sat_solver.cpp

Both can be compiled by entering _make_ at the command line.  

A sample invocation of sentences would be:  
./sentences words1.in words1.out  

A sample invocation of sat_solver would be:  
./sat_solver test.cnf test.out
