HW1 consists of three main files that can be compiled and run:  
sum_pairs.cpp  
tweet_parse.cpp  
str_test.cpp  with str.cpp

Compile sum_pairs.cpp with the following command:  
g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 sum_pairs.cpp -o sum_pairs  
A sample invocation of the program would be:  
./sum_pairs input.txt output.txt

Compile tweet_parse.cpp with the following command:  
g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 tweet_parse.cpp -o tweet_parse  
A sample invocation of the program would be:  
./tweet_parse tweets.txt

Compile str_test.cpp with the following command:  
g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 str.cpp str_test.cpp -o str_test  
A sample invocation of the program would be:  
./str_test
