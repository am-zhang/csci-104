HW2 consists of two main files that can be compiled and run:  
setops_test.cpp  
majors.cpp

Both can be compiled by entering _make_ at the command line.  

A sample invocation of setops_test would be:  
./setops_test  

A sample invocation of majors would be:  
./majors majors1.in majors1.cmd majors1.out  

Please check the comments in the above programs for any clarifications.
